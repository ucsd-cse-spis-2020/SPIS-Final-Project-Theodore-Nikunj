#Project Goal:
To create an online playable version of the card game mao. This game is similar to uno, (start with 7 cards, on turn discard card if it fits in sequence or else draw card) but with the added twist of the winner of each round gets to add a new rule. In person, the rule can be literally anything, but in our version we want to add some "ad lib" rules just so these rules can be implemented


##Game functionality:
card mechanics, similar to uno
chat function (interacts with player created rules)
additional rules between rounds


###Base rules
played card must be in sequence with last by suit or number
cards that match suit and number can be played out of turn
checking the rules adds a card
talking in chat adds a card (unless fulfilling a rule)
everytime someone penalizes you, you must say thank you in chat
everytime someone plays a seven, they must say "have a nice day." any immediate consecutive sevens must be followed by "have a very nice day"


###Possible added rules:
trade hand
draw cards
wild card
skip
reverse
type a phrase in chat after playing a certain card, suit, or color
